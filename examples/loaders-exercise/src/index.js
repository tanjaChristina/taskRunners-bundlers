EXERCISE TODO:
exercise 1: add image to the dependency tree, then add loader configuration so it can be processed
Tip: see asset management (Asset Modules) in webpack documentation [https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/]

exercise 2: if you finish fast, here's an additional challenge for you :)
    1: add additional images to our little project
    2: create a .html file, where you reference/ use those new images so they show would show up
    3: add the html file to your dependency tree (+ configure a fitting loader)
    4: watch your new images be outputted to your dist directory
